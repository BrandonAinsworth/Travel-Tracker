## Project Overview

This project, hereby dubbed "GlobeTrotter", is a vanilla JS responsive website which utilizes a local server to GET and POST data. The site itself functions as a travel agency, where a user can see all their trips (past, present, upcoming and pending), how much they've spent on trips for the current year, and functionality to request trips for acceptance to a travel agent. GlobeTrotter, we go much further than Harlem!

The [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) provided a project spec sheet for students to follow. [Travel Tracker](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html).


## Technologies and Tools

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Fetch API
* Mocha
* Chai
* NPM
* Webpack


## Roadmap

Future features could include:

* Travel Agent Interface
* Shift to MicroModal
* Display a countdown to the users nearest trip
* Enhanced styling leveraging SCSS

## Setup
1. Fork and clone the local Travel-Tracker API server [here]()
2. Cd into the root directory and run `npm install`
3. To run this server, run `npm start` in the terminal. To stop the local server, use command `Control + C`. Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.
4. Fork _this_ repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.
5. Clone down the _forked_ repo. 
6. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
7. Run `npm start` in the terminal, to see the HTML page `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use.
8. Open a browser window and go to http://localHost:8080 to view the website
